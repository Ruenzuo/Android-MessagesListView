Usage:
======

_For a working implementation of this project see the `example/` folder._

1. Declare `MessagesListView` on your layout file.

```xml
<com.ruenzuo.messageslistview.widget.MessagesListView
    android:id="@+id/messageListView"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"/>
```

2. Create a `Message` model collection, containing all the messages you want to display.

3. On your activity `onCreate` method (or `onCreateView`for a fragment), setup the `MessageAdapter` as follows:

```java
MessagesListView messageListView = (MessagesListView) findViewById(R.id.messageListView);
MessageAdapter messageAdapter = new MessageAdapter(this, 0);
messageAdapter.addAll(messages);
messageListView.setAdapter(messageAdapter);
```

Including In Your Project:
==========================

Android-MessagesListView is presented as an Android library project. A standalone JAR is not possible due to the theming capabilities offered by the indicator widgets.

You can include this project by referencing it as a library project.
